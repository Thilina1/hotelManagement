/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Restaurant Staff Management System
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and public access with owner-only writes for most other collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`, where `{userId}` matches the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - Other collections like `/rooms`, `/reservations`, `/menuItems`, `/tables`, `/orders`, `/bills` are top-level collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly controlled via path-based ownership on `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Write access to user profiles is restricted to the owning user.
 * - Top-level collections can be made publicly readable by default.
 *
 *  Denormalization for Authorization: There is no need to denormalize data as only the authenticated user should have access to user profiles, supporting the required QAPs through structural segregation.
